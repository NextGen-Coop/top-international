# ngc-website
The public website for NextGen Cooperative.

If you want to contribute, you can clone the repo using `git clone git@github.com:NextGen-Coop/ngc-website.git` or by using the Github CLI tool `gh repo clone NextGen-Coop/ngc-website`.

Once you've cloned locally, you'll want to start the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) server by running `jekyll serve`.  You can then visit the local site at http://localhost:4000/.

If you need specific help with the way Jekyll sets up the site structure, please ask in Discord.
